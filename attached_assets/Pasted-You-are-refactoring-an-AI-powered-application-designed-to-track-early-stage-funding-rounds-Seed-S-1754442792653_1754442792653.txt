You are refactoring an AI-powered application designed to track early-stage funding rounds (Seed & Series A) in the climate tech space, specifically for VC associates focused on Grid Modernization and Carbon Capture.
Your goal is to redesign the application architecture around the product‚Äôs actual job-to-be-done rather than just generic files like app.py, config.py, or scraper.py.

‚úÖ Objectives:
1. Organize the codebase by functionality, not file type.
Create domain-specific folders and modules such as:
/core
    funding_event.py         # core data model
    extractor.py             # LLM-based data extraction logic
    processor.py             # filtering and formatting logic
/sources
    scraper.py               # web scraper logic
    api_ingestor.py          # API-based data collection
    source_registry.py       # unified list of known funding sources
/ui
    dashboard.py             # Streamlit/FastAPI/Flask frontend
    filters.py               # logic for sector/stage/date filtering
/data
    schema.sql               # database schema (if needed)
    vc_sample_data.py        # sample mock data
/tests
    test_extractor.py
    test_scraper.py
config.py
main.py                     # entry point, wires components together
**2. Reframe logic into real-world functional boundaries, such as:
"Ingest new funding events"
"Extract insights with AI"
"Display insights in UI"
"Export data to report"
Avoid generic naming like "utils.py" or "helper.py" ‚Äî use action-oriented module names instead.
3. Clarify responsibilities per module:
Each module or function should have one clear, high-level purpose aligned with the core user flow:
Functional Block	Purpose
/sources/scraper.py	Scrapes raw news or blog articles
/core/extractor.py	Uses LLM to extract startup, sector, stage, etc.
/core/processor.py	Filters by relevance (e.g., only Grid Modernization/Seed)
/ui/dashboard.py	Displays results and supports filters
/data/vc_sample_data.py	Holds sample/mock data for local testing
üõ†Ô∏è Prompt (for yourself or your LLM assistant):
Refactor the codebase to better reflect the application's end-to-end flow and core purpose, which is:
‚ÄúTo help a climate VC associate find relevant early-stage deals in specific climate subsectors, fast.‚Äù
Base the application structure on functional responsibilities, not file extensions.
Eliminate unnecessary boilerplate and make modules clearly understandable from their names.

Ensure the following jobs are clearly represented in the code:

Ingest funding data (scraping, APIs)
Extract structured insights (LLM)
Filter to relevant sectors/stages
Display in UI with basic filters
(Optional) Export to CSV or report
Break apart or rename any modules that try to do more than one of these.
Add comments and docstrings that reflect user-facing purpose, not internal logic only.
üì¶ Bonus: Rename app.py ‚Üí main.py or dashboard.py
This makes the app easier to understand at a glance. Only use app.py if you're making an installable package.
