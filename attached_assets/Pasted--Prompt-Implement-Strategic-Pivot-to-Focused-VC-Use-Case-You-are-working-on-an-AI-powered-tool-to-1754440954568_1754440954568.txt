🔧 Prompt: Implement Strategic Pivot to Focused VC Use Case
You are working on an AI-powered tool to track climate tech startup funding events. This tool was previously too broad in scope. Based on critical feedback, you're now refining the application to focus on a single, high-impact user:
An Associate at a climate-focused VC firm responsible for tracking weekly seed and Series A deal flow in specific climate sub-sectors.
This user is especially interested in two sectors:
Grid Modernization
Carbon Capture
They need a weekly update of new deals in those sectors and want to know who is leading each round, especially to track competitor activity.
🧭 Implementation Steps
✅ Step 1: Refactor LLM Prompt (for classification + enrichment)
Update the LLM prompt used in your data labeling/analysis pipeline. Instruct it to focus only on extracting the following five essential data points from scraped funding event text:
1. startup_name
2. subsector (must match target sectors: Grid Modernization or Carbon Capture)
3. funding_stage (only Seed or Series A — discard others)
4. amount_raised
5. lead_investor (highest priority)
✅ Add instructions to ignore funding events outside of these subsectors or stages.
✅ Ask the LLM to assign confidence scores to each field extracted.

✅ Step 2: Update the Scraper Logic
Modify your scraping logic to:
Filter or tag articles/posts that mention “grid,” “transmission,” “carbon capture,” “carbon storage,” etc.
Prioritize sources that frequently publish funding news (e.g. TechCrunch, Climate Tech VC, PitchBook blog, etc.)
Store metadata such as:
Source URL
Date of publication
Raw text blob (used for LLM processing)
✅ Step 3: Update Your Database Schema
Ensure your database schema or structured dataset supports:
Field	Description
startup_name	Name of funded startup
subsector	Categorized climate sub-sector
funding_stage	Seed or Series A
amount_raised	USD amount
lead_investor	Name of lead investor
confidence_score	LLM-generated rating for each field
source_url	Original link
published_date	Date the funding event was announced
✅ Step 4: UI Integration – Align Front-End to Core User Flow
Revise the UI to support this new core user action:
“Find all new Seed or Series A funding rounds in Grid Modernization and Carbon Capture from the last 7–14 days, with clear info on who led the round.”
🔲 Add filters:
Sector filter: Grid Modernization / Carbon Capture
Date range: Past 7, 14, or 30 days
Funding stage: Seed / Series A
Optional: Filter by known competitor firms (based on lead investor)
✅ Make the lead investor field visually prominent.
✅ Add export-to-CSV and "Add to Weekly Report" options for users.

✅ Step 5: Concrete Next Sprint Goals
Sprint Goal	Details
Fix chrome/chromedriver issue	This unblocks the scraping pipeline. First priority.
Update LLM prompt for 5 essential fields	Refine data labeling accuracy.
Integrate confidence scores	Allow filtering by reliability.
Redesign UI to match new use case	Filterable, focused, minimal.
Load sample dataset of 25 events	Use static input if scraping is delayed.
🧠 Use this Sample LLM Instruction Prompt:
You are an expert data extraction agent focused on climate tech funding events. From the text below, extract only the following fields: startup_name, subsector (must match Grid Modernization or Carbon Capture), funding_stage (only Seed or Series A), amount_raised, and lead_investor. Ignore events that do not match this criteria. Include a 0-1 confidence score for each extracted field. Format as JSON.
✅ Summary
You are no longer building a broad tool. You are building a precision instrument for a specific climate VC associate. Every system component — from LLM prompts to UI filters — must support their one core task.
🎯 Focus user: Climate VC associate doing weekly deal reports
🔍 Core job: Find recent Seed/A deals in grid & carbon capture
📊 Critical data: 5 fields (startup, subsector, stage, amount, lead)
